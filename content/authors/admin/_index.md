Hello! My name is Ray Garner and I am a postdoc in the Astronomy Group at [Texas A&M University](https://physics.tamu.edu/) in College Station, Texas. I am working with [Dr. Rob Kennicutt](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/robert-kennicutt) on the Star formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey ([SIGNALS](https://signal-survey.org/)), a survey of HII regions across ~60 galaxies. You can check out the survey paper [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.5530R/abstract). 

Before I arrived in College Station, I was a graduate student at [Case Western Reserve University](https://astronomy.case.edu/) in Cleveland, Ohio working with [Prof. Chris Mihos](https://burro.case.edu/) on a detailed analysis of the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) and its small satellite group using the deep, wide-field, narrowband imaging capabilities of the Burrell Schmidt 24/36-inch telescope.  

Briefly, my thesis utilizes narrowband images of Hα, Hβ, [OIII]λλ4959,5007, and [OII]λλ3726,3729. These images allowed me to search the entire M101 Group for outlying, intragroup star-forming regions (finding none), measure the oxygen abundance gradient of M101 (suggesting a broken gradient at $R_{25}$), and constrain stellar ages throughout the entire disk (finding a very dynamic spiral pattern). You can read more about that research below, or click [here]({{< relref "/publication" >}}). 

Before attending CWRU, I was a student at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu) in Greenville, South Carolina where I graduated with a B.S. in Physics, Summa Cum Laude. While there, I completed research in general relativity with [Dr. Bill Baker](https://www.furman.edu/people/william-m-baker) (ret.). During the summer of 2017, I attended a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu) in Bloomington, Indiana. There, I worked on ionized gas kinematics of nearby, low-mass galaxies with the late Dr. Liese van Zee.
