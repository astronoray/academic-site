abstract: "We present the spectra of two faint star-forming objects originally identified in our deep narrowband survey of the M101 Group. One is an isolated HII region near the M101 Group galaxy NGC 5474, and the other is projected close to the background galaxy NGC 5486. Both are spectroscopically confirmed to be physically associated with their nearby host. We estimate the oxygen abundances for each system using strong-line methods. For the source near NGC 5474, we use _GALEX_ UV photometry to estimate an age of ~200 Myr and suggest a connection to the M101-NGC 5474 interaction."
