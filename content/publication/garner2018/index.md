abstract: 'Starbursting dwarf galaxies are thought to be the prime candidate for exhibiting out- flow of material: they are undergoing massive star formation periods and have masses small enough for the material to escape the small gravity well. However, the outflow rates for most dwarf galaxies, starbursting or post-starbursting, are still relatively un- constrained. This project sets out to observe and catalog the possible outflow of the average dwarf galaxy. Eighteen dwarf galaxies were observed during three observing runs from 2015 to 2017 using the SparsePak spectrometer at the WIYN telescope. Data reductions were made and maps of the H$\alpha$ flux, rotational velocity, and velocity dispersion were made, as well as maps for the [SII]/H$\alpha$ and [SII] ratios. Evidence for outflow was observed for few galaxies by comparing the velocity dispersion and HÎ± flux maps. For those that had outflow events, morphological features were identified as well in a majority of them.'
