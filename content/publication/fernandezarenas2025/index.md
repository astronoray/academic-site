abstract: "NGC 4258 is a prime target for studying feedback in Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) due to its proximity and comprehensive multi-wavelength coverage. Using new Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we analysed the galaxy's nebular emission lines. Our study focused on spatially resolved line ratios and Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams, revealing that the 'anomalous spiral arms' exhibit intense interactions between the jet and interstellar medium (ISM) extending up to 6 kpc with velocity dispersions peak at 200-250&#160;km/s in these regions, contrasting with star-forming areas showing lower values around of 30-50&#160;km/s. Analysis of covering fractions indicates heightened AGN ionization cones aligns with the radio jet, alongside evidence of shock quenching observed in the lower 'anomalous arc'. Conversely, jet-induced compression may stimulate star formation in other areas. We derived a galaxy-wide star formation rate of ~3&#160;M$\\_\\odot$&#160;yr$^{-1}$, decreasing to 0.3&#160;M$\\_\\odot$&#160;yr$^{-1}$ within the central 3.4&#160;kpc$^2$. SITELLE's broad field coverage elucidates the galaxy's structural details, confirming that low-power jets significantly influence the host galaxy across parsec and kpc scales. The velocity dispersion map reveals asymmetric or double-peaked emission lines, traicing jet-disk interactions likely responsible for the formation of anomalous arm features. Small-scale ionizing clusters were detected in regions with disrupted gas flows, possibly formed through tidal interactions or shock compression. NGC 4258 thus presents a compelling case for studying LLAGN-driven feedback, illustrating how optical IFS combined with multi-wavelength data clarifies the impact of outflows and shocks on nearby spiral galaxies, providing insights into how these processes shape star formation and ISM conditions."
