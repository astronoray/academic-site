abstract: "We observed the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 with the Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE, covering the full extent of its optical disc, as part of the SIGNALS survey. Taking advantage of the blue sensitivity of our setup we measure the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of a large sample of HII regions, and focus our analysis on the abundance fluctuations about the radial gradients. We detect an azimuthal variation across the width of the main, NE spiral arm for both elements, with an amplitude of ~0.1 dex, and disucss this result within the context of the radial gas flows along spiral arms predicted by galaxy simulations. We examine the 2D distribution of the O/H and N/H abundance ratios across the galaxy disc by deriving the two-point correlation, finding that the correlation scales of the two elements, which depend on their injection into the ISM and subsequent mixing, are comparable, despite the different nucleosynthetic origin."
