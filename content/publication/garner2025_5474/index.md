abstract: "A satellite galaxy of the nearby spiral M101, NGC 5474 has a prominent bulge offset from the kinematic center of the underlying
star-forming disk that has gained attention in recent years. Recent studies have proposed that this putative offset bulge is not a classical
bulge within the plane of the disk but instead a dwarf companion galaxy along the line-of-sight. Using integral field spectroscopy data taken 
as part of the PPak IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey (PINGS), we perform the first analysis of the stellar and gas kinematics of this putative bulge
and portions of the disk. We find a radial velocity offset of ~24 km/s between the emission lines produced by the disk HII regions and the 
absorption lines produced by the putative bulge stellar component. We interpret this velocity offset as evidence that the putative bulge and disk
are two separate objects, the former orbiting around the latter, supporting simulations and obserations of this peculiar system. We attempt to place
this external companion into the context of the M101 Group and the M101-NGC 5474 interaction."
