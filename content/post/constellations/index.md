subtitle: A Python Project to Chart the 88 Constellations

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Over the last several years, I've been working on a project to both chart the 88 constellations in Python as well as compile an "Observing Guide" to the constellations. This is just a brief summary of that work and some beautiful charts!

Over the last several years, whenever I had some spare time, I worked on a little project to chart the 88 constellations in `Python`. I was heavily inspired by several different people online. Most of the impetus came from the work of two different people: [Eleanor Lutz's](https://github.com/eleanorlutz) [western_constellations_atlas_of_space](https://github.com/eleanorlutz/western_constellations_atlas_of_space) and [Péter Pápics' Leuven Star Atlas](https://papics.eu/2017/06/the-leuven-star-atlas-making-a-publication-quality-stellar-atlas-from-scratch/). Those two existing projects (the latter being on an indefinite hiatus) really helped me out, both with their code and their knowledge of existing databases. 

I have also always been interested in the mythology and history of the constellations, and I wanted some way to incorporate that. I decided that these charts could be the impetus for writing up an "Observer's Guide" to the constellations, complete with information about the history/mythos, meteor showers, stars, and deep sky objects for each constellation. This part of the project probably took the longest, but eventually I got it done!

Below is a small gallery of a few constellations so you can get an idea of what the charts look like. I tried to emulate the Sky & Telescope charts that are found on the Wikipedia pages for each constellation. The full `Python` code, databases used, and all the discussion can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/astronoray/constellation_figures). The "Observer's Guide" can also be found there as a PDF. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
