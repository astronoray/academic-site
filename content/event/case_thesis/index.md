summary: My PhD thesis defense summarizing the research and work I have done in the last five years as a PhD student in the Astronomy Department.
abstract:  "In this thesis, I present a series of in-depth studies on the nearby spiral galaxy M101 and its group environment. The M101 Group is a dynamic group, and thus it contains features both secular and tidal in origin: M101 is believed to have undergone an interaction with its most massive satellite NGC 5474 approximately 300 Myr ago. Each study utilized deep, wide-field, narrowband imaging from the Burrell Schmidt telescope targeting in the emission lines of Hα, Hβ, [OIII]λλ4959,5007, and [OII]λλ3726,3729."
