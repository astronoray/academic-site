summary: A public talk answering the question, "What was the Star of Bethlehem?"
abstract: Over two thousand years ago, three wise men traveled across a harsh desert through tough conditions for weeks to see the child that would one day be known to the world as Jesus Christ. They were guided to this child by a bright star, the Star of Bethlehem. But what was the Star of Bethlehem? Did it actually exist? And if it did exist, what could it have been? Was it a comet, a planet, a meteor, an actual star? This talk will explore a mixture of history and astronomy in our quest to answer these questions.
