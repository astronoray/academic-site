summary: A public talk serving as an introduction to the night sky!
abstract: "Did you know you can see a galaxy 2.5 million light years away with your unaided eye? Craters on the Moon with binoculars? The red glow of stars forming from their birth clouds? Countless wonders await you any clear night. The first step towards being an astronomer is to simply look up and ask, “What is that?” Tonight we will answer that question, exploring the night sky with all the tools available to us from our unaided eyes to telescopes available to amateurs everywhere. A few projects and ideas for the aspiring astronomer will also be given to get you started on your own journey through the night sky. Night sky viewing will happen after the talk."
