summary: A talk given in honor of the 53rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. 
abstract: Over fifty years ago, America became the first (and so far, only) nation to put a man on the Moon. That momentous event is one for the ages and was watched by millions of people worldwide. What is less remembered are all the smaller steps required to get to the Moon. This talk will take you through that journey, starting from the founding of the National Air and Space Administration (NASA), through the succeeding Apollo missions, to the perilous voyage of our heroes Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, and Neil Armstrong, to and from the Moon.
