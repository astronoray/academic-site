summary: A talk given to the community of Canton, OH about the history of interacting and peculiar galaxies and all that we know about them.   
abstract: It was only 100 years ago that Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains billions and billions of other galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He created a system to allow his fellow astronomers to classify galaxies at a glance. But there existed a subset of galaxies, _peculiar_ galaxies, that refused to be so easily cataloged. It took several more decades before astronomers realized that these were the wreckage of galactic collisions, a dance that takes place over billions of years. Come hear NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador Dr. Ray Garner give you the steps to this galactic dance and how the _James Webb Space Telescope_ is giving us new insights into these peculiar galaxies!
