title: "AggieSTAAR: Introduction to HII Regions"

event: "AggieSTAAR Lunch Presentations"
event_url: 

location: Texas A&M University - Munnerlyn Astronomy & Space Sciences Engineering Building 
address:
  street: 4242 TAMU
  city: College Station
  region: Texas
  postcode: '77843'
  country: United States

summary: This talk was given as part of a weekly lunch talk for the undergraduates in the Aggie Scholarships for Technology Advancements in Astronomical Research (AggieSTAAR) program. In it, I gave an overview of the atomic physics of HII regions and how we use that to study, in particular, the abundances of HII regions. Some information about the SIGNALS collaboration was given as an application. 
abstract: This talk was given as part of a weekly lunch talk for the undergraduate researchers in the Aggie Scholarships for Technology Advancements in Astronomical Research (AggieSTAAR) program. In this talk, I gave an overview of HII regions, what they are and how we use atomic physics to study them. I talked in detail about photoionization and recombination and how metals are necessary to cool HII regions. After giving an example spectrum, I introduced how we measure the oxygen abundance of HII regions via the direct method as well as strong-line methods. Finally, I used my experience in the SIGNALS collaboration to show some applications of what we learn about galaxies after estimating HII region abundances. The talk was followed by a Q&A session with the undergraduates, ranging from research to job prospects.
