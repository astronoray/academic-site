summary: Part of the Oceans of Possibilities Summer Program!
abstract: Our home planet, the Earth, is the only object in the solar system covered with liquid water. But it is not the only object in the solar system that has water! Join NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador Ray Garner as we explore the watery worlds of the solar system, from the salty slurries on Mars to the ice hidden away in dark craters on Ceres and the water buried beneath miles of ice on Europa. Using images and data from planetary probes, we’ll answer such questions as “How did the water get there?” And “What exactly are cryovolcanoes?” And “What does this mean for life in the solar system?” Come and get your sea legs as we sail the seas of the solar system!
