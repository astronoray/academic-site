summary: A talk given to the Undergraduate Research Society as part of their colloquium Journal Club series to get students exposed to research that might be of interest to them.  
abstract: The attending students will read Toomre & Toomre's seminal 1972 paper _Galactic Bridges and Tails_ (sections 2, 5, and 7). Then I will lead them through some of the historical context of "normal" galaxies and "peculiar" galaxies. I'll connect the Toomres' work to ongoing work in understanding galaxy evolution and how the Milky Way will evolve in the future.
