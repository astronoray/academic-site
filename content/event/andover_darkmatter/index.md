summary: A brief summary of what we know and don't know about dark matter and how _JWST_ will cause astronomers to rethink everything!  
abstract: "Astronomers have tallied up all of the matter in the universe and have come to a startling conclusion: 85% of it is missing! This missing matter is called “dark matter,” and it is completely undetectable with telescopes. Yet somehow it governs how galaxies behave and how structure in the universe formed! Searches for this elusive type of matter has turned up nothing: no WIMPs, no MACHOs, and nothing in between. Some astronomers have even suggested rewriting the laws of gravity to account for this missing matter! Come hear NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador Ray Garner explain all there is to know about dark matter and, more importantly, how the _James Webb Space Telescope_ is already causing astronomers to rethink what they thought they knew about it!"
